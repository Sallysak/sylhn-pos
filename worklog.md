Task ID: 1
Agent: Main (Super Z)
Task: Create a dynamic, interactive, modern grocery store POS system based on the attached POS.jpg reference image.

Work Log:
- Analyzed POS.jpg using VLM (z-ai vision) to extract layout, color scheme, sections, and UI elements
- Initialized fullstack Next.js 16 environment (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, framer-motion, lucide-react)
- Created product catalog data file (/src/lib/pos-data.ts) with 90 grocery products across 10 categories (Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy & Eggs, Meat & Poultry, Bakery, Beverages, Snacks, Frozen Foods, Pantry, Household)
- Created TypeScript types file (/src/lib/pos-types.ts) for CartItem and PaymentResult
- Built main POS page (/src/app/page.tsx) - a comprehensive single-file implementation featuring:
  * Header bar with store branding, search bar, scanner toggle, date/time clock, daily sales total, transaction counter, cashier profile
  * Category navigation bar with 11 color-coded category buttons (gradient backgrounds, item counts)
  * Left product grid panel (~60%) with 90 product cards showing emoji, name, SKU, price, unit, stock, TAX/LOW badges, in-cart quantity badge
  * Right cart panel (~40%) with: customer name input, held orders recall, cart table (item/qty/price/disc%/total), totals section (subtotal, discount %, GST tax, total due), 7 function buttons (Save F2, Print F3, Void F4, Open Cash, Delete Line, Enter, PAY NOW F5), and a 12-key numeric keypad with Qty/Price/Barcode modes
  * Payment modal: 3 payment methods (Cash/Card/Digital Wallet), quick cash buttons ($5/$10/$20/$50/$100), exact amount button, change calculation, complete payment
  * Receipt modal: success animation, store info, itemized list, totals breakdown, Print & New Sale actions
  * Cash drawer opening animation
  * Keyboard shortcuts (F2-F5, Escape)
  * Low-stock notifications via toast
  * Framer Motion animations (layout, hover, tap, modal transitions)
- Updated layout.tsx metadata to "FreshMart POS - Grocery Store Point of Sale"
- Fixed ESLint error (keyboard effect referencing functions before declaration) by moving effect after function declarations
- Verified with Agent Browser:
  * Page loads cleanly, no console errors
  * Two-panel layout renders correctly
  * Category filter works (Dairy & Eggs shows only dairy products)
  * Search works ("chicken" returns Chicken Breast + Whole Chicken)
  * Add to cart works (3 items added, subtotal $7.87 correct)
  * Payment flow works (modal opens, exact amount, complete payment)
  * Receipt modal shows "Payment Successful!" with full receipt
  * Daily Sales total updates to $7.87 after transaction
  * New Sale resets cart for next customer
- Design: Modern emerald/teal gradient theme, white panels with subtle shadows, rounded corners, professional grocery store aesthetic

Stage Summary:
- Successfully recreated the POS.jpg concept as a modern, professional, interactive web-based POS system for grocery stores
